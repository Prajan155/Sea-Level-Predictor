# Sea-Level-Predictor
[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/Prajan155/Sea-Level-Predictor)

This project analyzes global sea level change since 1880. It uses Python with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy to visualize the data, calculate lines of best fit, and predict future sea level rise.

The script generates a scatter plot of the historical data and overlays two lines of best fit to predict future trends:
1.  A regression line based on the entire dataset from 1880 to the most recent year available.
2.  A second regression line based on the more recent data from the year 2000 onwards, to account for a potential acceleration in sea level rise.

## Features
*   Loads sea level data from a CSV file.
*   Visualizes historical sea level data using a Matplotlib scatter plot.
*   Uses SciPy to perform linear regression and calculate two distinct trend lines.
*   Projects future sea level rise based on both historical and recent trends.
*   Saves the final plot as `sea_level_plot.png`.

## Requirements
*   Python 3.x
*   Pandas
*   Matplotlib
*   SciPy
*   A data file named `epa-sea-level.csv` containing the dataset.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prajan155/Sea-Level-Predictor.git
    cd Sea-Level-Predictor
    ```

2.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib scipy
    ```

## Data
This project requires the `epa-sea-level.csv` data file. 

**Note:** The path to this file is currently hardcoded in `sea_level_predictor.py`. You must download the dataset and update the path in the script to match its location on your system.

```python
# In sea_level_predictor.py, modify this line:
df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/darkm/OneDrive/Desktop/PROJECTS/epa-sea-level.csv")
```

## Usage
To run the analysis and generate the plot, ensure you have updated the data file path as mentioned above. Then, execute the `main.py` script from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will perform the analysis, display the plot, and save the output as `sea_level_plot.png` in the project's root directory. The script will also automatically run the included unit tests after generating the plot.

## Output
The script generates an image file (`sea_level_plot.png`) containing the "Rise in Sea Level" chart.

The plot includes:
-   A scatter plot of "CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level" data from 1880 to 2013.

-   A red line of best fit predicting sea level up to the year 2050 based on all available data.

-   A green line of best fit predicting sea level up to the year 2500 based on data from the year 2000 onwards.

## Testing
The repository includes a test suite in `test_module.py` to ensure the plot is generated correctly. The tests verify the plot's title, labels, and the data points for the regression lines.

You can run the tests in two ways:
1.  **Automatically:** The tests are executed automatically after the plot is generated by running `main.py`.
2.  **Manually:** Run the tests independently using Python's `unittest` module:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest test_module.py
